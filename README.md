Visualization for spacio-temporal data from [Wikidata](http://www.wikidata.org/).

This is a Vizualisation for large datasets of spacio-temporal data from Wikidata. Events for a selected time-intervall are shown as aggregate points in a map like fashion. The datasets are currently in JSON format and can be generated with [ViziDataPreprocessor](https://github.com/gordelwig/ViziDataPreprocessor).

A working demo can currently be viewed [here](http://wwwpub.zih.tu-dresden.de/~s5219191/vizidata/).
